    "\n",
    "The `players.csv` dataset contains the data necessary to answer this specific question, formatted already into a table such that the explanatory variables, `played_hours` (total number of hours played) and `Age` (age of player), are in their own columns and can be analyzed to see if they can predict the response variable, `subscribe` (whether or not the player subscribes to the game-related newsletter). Each player is one observation in this dataset, so we can easily compare these variables for each player and see if the explanatory variables are good predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since only the variables from the `players.csv` dataset are relevant to this question, only this dataset will be wrangled and used in the analysis, other than gathering summary statistics for the `sessions.csv` dataset. "
